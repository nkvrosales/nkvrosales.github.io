### Design Inspiration
The design inspiration for the website is minimalist and user-friendly. The clean layout ensures easy navigation, and the reason for the usage of blue is because it is my favorite color.

### Creativity
The website demonstrates creativity through:
- **Minimalism:** The design embraces minimalism, creating a clean and uncluttered visual experience. A white background contributes to a simple and elegant aesthetic, ensuring a focus on content and easy readability.
- **Color:** The use of blue throughout the design adds a touch of color without overwhelming the simplicity. This choice enhances visual appeal.
- **Project Presentation:** Displaying projects with images and titles for a comprehensive overview.

### Deployment
The website was deployed using GitHub Pages. This is a free service offered by GitHub that allows GitHub users to host their own website directly from their GitHub repository.

### Insights and Struggles

While accomplishing the tasks, it helped me learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Which was a huge help in creating this personal website. 

The struggles that I encountered while accomplishing the tasks are when an error occurred when importing and calling the method showing an error of "import statement outside the module".

### Future Improvements
In the future, the website could be improved by adding more interactive elements to engage users, updating the design and make it cleaner. Regularly updating the website to reflect my latest achievements and skills is another way to improve the website.
